# Julia Function Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in a Julia function that involves unexpected behavior when handling negative input values. The function `my_function` is designed to square positive numbers and return the negative of negative numbers. However, under certain conditions, it produces incorrect results.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle the intended logic.

## Bug Description

The `my_function` is supposed to return the square of a positive input and the negation of a negative input.  However, testing shows unexpected outputs under certain conditions, highlighting a potential logic error.

## Solution

The solution addresses the logic flaw, resulting in consistently accurate output for both positive and negative inputs.
